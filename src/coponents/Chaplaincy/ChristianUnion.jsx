        <h2>About Christian Union</h2>
        <p>
          The Christian Union at Malindi High School is a student-led organization that provides
          a safe space for spiritual growth and fellowship. We believe in the power of prayer,
          the authority of Scripture, and the transformative love of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to evangelize, disciple, and equip students to live out their faith
          boldly in school and beyond. Through worship, teaching, and community service, we
          strive to be salt and light in our generation.
        </p>
